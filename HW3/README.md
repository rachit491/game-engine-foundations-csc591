##Part 1,2 & 3
	Folder Name - HW3 JAR
	Steps-
		1. Run the GameServer-HW3.jar file, wait for 2 mins.
		2. Now run the GameClient-HW3.jar file to start a client. 
		3. In order to run multiple clients, create a copy of GameClient-HW3.jar and double-click them.
		4. Make sure you quit the jar from the task bar even after closing the game applet window, as the server will still be executing.

Please Note - I'm using the same socket number 7172 for all of my projects part files.

The folder HW3 contains the Java code for Part 1,2 & 3.
The folder HW3Part4 contains the Java code for Part 4.
